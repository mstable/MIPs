## Simple Summary, Abstract & Motivation

It is proposed that the mStableDAO allocate some of its mUSD treasury funds to dHEDGE as was proposed by @phenrikand in this forum post.

The amount of mUSD to be deployed on dHEDGE is being voted on in [TDP 21.1](./tdp-21.1). These mUSD are being deployed with the intent of earning a return.

## Specification

Multiple strategies were proposed as options for where the mUSD should be allocated with dHEDGE.
