## Simple Summary

This funding request is intended to fund all operations of the Ecosystem subDAO from September 2022 through December 2022. The Ecosystem subDAO is the end result of merging the previous Grants DAO and the Community subDAO

## Abstract

The Ecosystem subDAO, which is a subsidiary of the mStableDAO, will be established to further decentralize the funding, planning, and execution of community-centric and initiatives. It operates with the goal of supporting and growing a strong ecosystem of users and integration partners around the mStable platform. The Ecosystem subDAO will function independently from the other wings of the mStableDAO.
