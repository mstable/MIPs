## Simple Summary

It is proposed to purchase between 3 and 5 [$SACKS](https://store.gitcoin.co/products/sacks) (7,875 to 13,250 mUSD at the time of writing) in order to allocate a small portion of treasury funds towards public goods in a novel way, to make $SACKS more usable in the ecosystem, and to hold the remaining $SACKS ourselves for treasury diversification purposes.

## Abstract

The mStable community mentioned that we ought to do more for the public goods space on Ethereum with our treasury, so after [this successful temperature check](../assets/TDP-30/sacks-temperature-check.png), it is proposed to allocate a small portion of our treasury towards buying 3 to 5 $SACKS from the open market. 

After the purchase, 1 or 2 $SACKS will get kicked back to [GitcoinDAO](https://gitcoindao.com/) to use freely as they see fit to further the Gitcoin project, while a further $SACKS will be handed to [Atlantis World](https://atlantis.world/) to use for a tighter integration in the Atlantiverse, while the mStable TreasuryDAO will retain the remaining $SACKS in perpetuity as a provable scarce asset on the blockchain.

## Motivation

The treasury has not yet allocated any meaningful funding to Gitcoin this year, and with this purchase, we would be able to do so in a novel way that also benefits the treasury and the ecosystem as a whole in the process.

It would also be anticipated that other DAOs and individuals will join this effort based on this initial idea to kick back $SACKS to Gitcoin and other protocols that weave together and maintain the ecosystem, and in the process increase the value of $SACKS for everyone. 

## Specification

### Proposed workflow

The suggested method of purchase is to market buy 3 to 5 $SACKS from Uniswap ([around 1.77 to 2.95 ETH](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool/25670) at the current market rate) from the Asset Management subDAO's additional DAI that got generated between the resolution of [TDP 26](./tdp-26) and now, and "kick" them to the respective recipients via multi-sig transactions.

The SACKS for Atlantis World will be kicked to [this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8ca2fbf18c57999d07109ef257d5340746efbc9d).

The SACKS for Gitcoin will be kicked in parts to the [Matching Pool Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6), as well as the [internal Gitcoin Holdings](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd73b03f1ea390feb20d879e4dfb83f1245c8d4be) multisig.

The remaining $SACKS will then be kicked to the [mStable TreasuryDAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3dd46846eed8d147841ae162c8425c08bd8e1b41).
