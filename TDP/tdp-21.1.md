## Simple Summary, Abstract & Motivation

It is proposed that the mStableDAO allocate some of its mUSD treasury funds to dHEDGE as was proposed by @phenrikand in this forum post.

## Specification

This mUSD would be deployed on dHEDGE under one of the strategies being voted on in [TDP 21.2](https://mips.mstable.org/TDP/tdp-21.2.html) to earn a passive return.
