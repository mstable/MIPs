## Simple Summary

It is motioned to extend the [MCCP 4](./mccp-4) reward emission window for another 6 weeks. This extension will run from July 19th, until a final distribution on Monday, August 23rd, 2021, and consists of 6 weekly emissions of 242,308 MTA.

## Abstract

[MCCP 4](./mccp-4) proposed a prospective emission schedule over the next few years and a set of rules to follow in order to calculate weekly distributions. MCCP 4 sought out to bring all the incentives “in-house” and to create better circular effects while reducing MTA sell pressure and maximizing TVL. It laid out an emission schedule and a set of rules to follow in order to calculate weekly distributions. A key aspect of this emission schedule was to front-load the emissions until 19th July 2021. Additionally, it was specified in the following years to ramp down the emission until 2027.

[MCCP 7](./mccp-7) later amended it and carved out a portion to distribute on Polygon.

This MCCP proposes to extend the reward emission window for another 6 weeks. This extension will run from July 19th, until a final distribution on Monday, August 23rd, 2021, and consists of 6 weekly emissions of 242,308 MTA (see figure).

## Motivation

This is being done as a stopgap measure to allow the mStable core contributors, community and Governors to reach consensus on a long term emission plan for MTA that factors in more complex factors such as a longer reward emission epoch, staking v2, and a data driven approach to how MTA rewards are accruing value to the mStable protocol.
