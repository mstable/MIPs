## Simple Summary

It is proposed to decide on the future pathway the mStableDAO will take based upon the suggestions given by core contributors, community and Meta Governors in the forum. A follow-up MIP is proposed to be created after the successful resolution of MIP 29 to specify in detail how the winning proposition is going to be carried out by the mStableDAO.

## Abstract

The mStable project is facing major structural challenges, stemming from the MTA token price and an unsustainable burn rate. Further, no one in the current Builder subDAO has indicated a desire to reform and manage the subDAO going forward. It is proposed that MTA Governors decide on the next steps for the mStableDAO. 

## Motivation

mStable as a project is facing major structural challenges, which can be summarised as:

- the project will find it very difficult raise with the current token given its value;
- the protocol isn’t earning enough from its products to self-sustain;
- the DAO’s runway is continuing to decrease each month and will be depleted at current burn within 12 or so months.

Further, no one in the current Builder subDAO has indicated a desire to reform and manage the subDAO going forward.

These concerns were [expressed](https://forum.mstable.org/t/rfc-the-future-path-forward-for-mstable/977) in a recent RFC. mStable core contributors, community and investors found consensus that they would like MTA Governors to vote on a decisive way forward for the project.

After careful consideration of all opinions and proposed voting options expressed in the forum, it is proposed that MTA governors vote between the two options proposed below.

The motivation for reducing options to two is that any course of action other than an immediate shutdown would require another proposal from an outside entity. This means that the immediate path forward for the Builder subDAO and Ecosystem subDAO would be the same in each case. The team would work to facilitate merger or acquisition talks, work with other parties to discuss potential strategies to allow the project to continue, and assist with governance proposals. At the same time, the team would continue work on adding value to the product, while also assessing requirements to shutdown if no successful proposal is presented within 4 weeks.

The primary purpose of this vote is for MTA governors to decide if it is worth allowing a period of time for proposals to be presented which could allow the acquisition or continuation of the mStableDAO, or if it is considered that an immediate shutdown would be preferable. Additionally, this vote will guide the current Builder subDAO and Ecosystem subDAO in how resources should be allocated immediately following the resolution.

## Specification

Two options are proposed:

1. **Search for acquisition options from other DeFi projects for a limited period of 4 weeks starting upon resolution of the proposal.** 

**Alternatively, any other proposal can be made during this time which would allow the mStableDAO to continue to operate in some other way**. While no one in the current Builder subDAO has indicated a desire to reform and manage the subDAO going forward, proposals will be open for consideration during this period from the current Builder subDAO or elsewhere. 
    
**Should both these routes prove unsuccessful after 4 weeks, the Builder subDAO would proceed with a full shutdown of the project.**
    
2. **Pursue a shutdown as soon as possible** - This will put all resources into getting the protocol and subsequent smart contracts and MTA token to a stage of shutdown without trying for any of the above mentioned options first. 

For the first voting option, it is proposed to set prerequisites in order to avoid any malicious governance behaviour during this period:

1. Proposers of a reform or acquisition strategy will need to lead the governance process around this proposal and takes ownership of its good execution. This is done to avoid trolling or suggestions without any follow-up skin in the game.
2. The Builder subDAO will update the mStable community via forum after 2 weeks on an update on current acquisition progress, and it is expected a formal proposal be made in following 2 weeks by any party interested in acquiring mStable in order to avoid needless delays and burn of funds.

In order to facilitate the next steps for Governance, the following clauses are also proposed to be added to the vote to ease complexity and ensure integrity of previously agreed-upon processes: 

1. **All regular governance processes be halted that coincide and would disrupt this process of a higher priority** - In detail, this means that new signer elections & upcoming monthly Governance Calls onwards will be halted until the resolution and carrying out of both MIP 29 and MIP 30 have concluded. This will ensure the integrity of the multisig is retained and the remaining runway and priorities maximized towards resolving this challenge.
2. **Upon resolution of MIP 29, the Builder subDAO be mandated to focus their efforts and current funding on facilitating a smooth transition for either outcome during this period prior to any new Funding Request** **or proposal issued** - This will ensure that the runway is being used to complete the wishes of Meta Governors as fast as possible regardless of outcome.

To secure required funding beyond the 1st of March, the Builder subDAO will put forward a interim Funding Request proposal to detail the costs associated with the winning vote in mind. Monthly TreasuryDAO Review Meetings will hold the Builder subDAO accountable to this request moving forward.
